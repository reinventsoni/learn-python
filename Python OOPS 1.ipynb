    "\n",
    "There are various programming paradigms which has evolved over the course of time, and Object Oriented Programming is one of the prevelant ones. Object Oriented Programming looks to reduce the complexity of the software development and provide structure to complex application by breaking them into individual entities, referred to as __Objects.__  These objects group a related set of information, referred to as __attributes__ and the actions that can be taken on the attirbutes, these actions are referred to __methods.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports Object Oriented Programming pardigm. It relies on\n",
    "* CLASSES -> to define the blueprint of what the Object should look like i.e., what attributes and what methods should be grouped together for that object\n",
    "* We then use this blueprint to create the actual Object -> this step is referred to as instantiate the object (from the defined class)\n",
    "\n",
    "Infact, under the hood, everything in Python is an Object. The primitive datatypes like __integer__, __string__, __float__, as well as various collections like __list__, __tuple__, __dictionary__ are implemented as \"default, readily available\" class for us programmers to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now whilst Python provides standard OBJECTS for us to use as fundamental building blocks to write our software, more often then not we have to define our own CLASSES to bring structure to the program that we are going to write as a programmer. Let's see how we can define our own CLASS and create our own OBJECT in the programs."
