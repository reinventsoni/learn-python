    "There are various way the file content can be read, once the file is opened and the reference is stored in a file handle. Following are the ways that can be leveraged:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __file.readline()__ : This method reads one line at a time including the new line character i.e. /n and returns it. Each time this method is called it will return the next line in the file until the end of file is reached. Once the end of file is reached it returns an empty string. We can include this function in a while loop that can continue to read the next line until end of file is encountered, this way the whole of the file can be read and processed accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "* __for line in file__: This mechanism is more succinct pythonic way of doing the same thing. This is a common loop that uses readline() on each iteration of the loop. If an entire file has to be read, and we need to apply same processing steps to each of the line then this is the best method to apply\n",
    "\n",
    "* __file.readlines()__: Using this method we can read the entire content of the file at once and turn it into the list of individual lines. This method returns a list with each element in the list representing one line\n",
    "\n",
    "* __file.read()__: This method read the entire content of the file and then returns that as a string. This is useful if we need to read the whole content of the file at once. In all probability we will have the process the CONTENT-STRING that is returned by this method to process the underlying data, for example splitting the string at newline character \\n to get access to individual lines\n"
